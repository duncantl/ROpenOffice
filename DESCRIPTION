Title: Basic reading of Open Office spreadsheets  and workbooks
Description: This is a simple start to reading workbooks and spreadsheets from
  Open Office documents.  Sometime we will incorporate the ideas from the RExcelXML
  package to be able to read and write workbooks and worksheets and subset
  the sheets symbolically.
  The reading of the spread sheets appears to work on simple examples,
  but may not be necessarily robust.  Examples of where it fails are appreciated.
